            <h4>Welcome to Steve's Country Favorites. This site is where I share my love of country music, icluding my favorite artists, songs, and concerts I have attended over the years.</h4>

        <p>My love for country music started at a really young and I have been a fan ever since. I have many favorite artists - Some include the lead singer of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish turned country superstar Darius Rucker, Brad Paisley, Ashley McBryde, Carly Pearce and many more.</p>
        re
        <p>There are many country songs I have enjoyed listening to over the years, even as the country genre has evolved from traditional sounding with the Carter Family (1927 - 1956) to more of a hip-hop rap blending with the remix of Meant to Be by Florida Georgia Line featuring pop singer Bebe Rexha (2018), and everything in between.</p>
        
        <p>I have been to many concerts over the years starting with Toby Keith in 2003 to Thomas Rhett in 2019.</p>
