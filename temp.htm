        <h4 style="margin: 0 30px 30px 30px; text-align: center;"><u>Overview</u> -</h4>
        <p style="margin: 0 40px; text-align: left;">
          My love for country music started at a really young and I have been a fan ever since. It is the primary genre of music that I listen to; I listened to when I was younger and still do this day, all the time. I was introduced to it by my parents. I can recall one of the first couple artists that I loved listening to were Brad Paisley and Blaine Larsen. Over the years, my taste in country has definitely evolved ranging from classic country (i.e. Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard) to modern pop-country (i.e. Florida Georgia Line, Kelsea Ballerini).

          Some things I have done since listening to country music, I started playing guitar at the age of 8 and my first guitar, a Little Martin was actually autographed by Blaine Larsen. I’ve gotten to visit a few radio stations as well like Sirius XM’s The Highway, 94.1 KMPS and 100.7 The Wolf as well as meet a few of the personalities: Storme Warren and Buzz Brainard from The Highway, Tony Thomas and Ichabod Caine from KMPS, and Fitz from 100.7 The Wolf.

        <p style="margin: 0 40px; text-align: left;">
            I have had the opportunity to meet some of my favorite ranging from my first encounter with Blaine Larsen to Kelsea Ballerini. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Blaine Larsen a few times, the first time being at a radio station Christmas event with 100.7 The Wolf in 2004, then in a Fred Meyer of all places in 2006, and the King County Fair in 2015.</p>

In addition, I have met Charles Esten, Lennon &amp; Maisy, Clare Bowen, and Chris Carmack, who are all from the ABC/CMT TV series Nashville.
